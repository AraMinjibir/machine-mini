# Machine
# Project Description

On my pursuit to have profiency in JavaScript, I designed this project to test my my basic background in JS.

The Project was designed to start and stop the Machine, as the user clicked the button immediately the text of the button will change from start machine to stop machine, there is a text that will be telling the user ''The Machine has Started!''. Likewise when the user clicked the button back to stop the machine both the button text and the text will change to 'Start Machine' and The 'The Machine has Stopped.''

The background color will change to darkblue and blue for both the container and the button and their text color  will change to white and blue immediately when the user clicked the button.
